**Entry 7**

**Kallisto fixed**

So, after looking everywhere why my output showed so low nr# of reads psuedoaligned, I realized that it was due to the silliest type of mistake of a input typing error... 
Being used to other bioinformatic tools that expect such an input, I had just typed in the forward and reverse reads in the incorrect order...

Correct input: 

    kallisto quant --index= HumanGTCh38cDNAncRNA_Kallisto_INDEX -b 100 -t 4 FR1.fa.gz  RR1.fa.gz  FR2.fa.gz  RR2.fa.gz  FR3.fa.gz RR3.fa.gz  FR4.fa.gz  RR4.fa.gz  FR5.fa.gz  RR5.fa.gz

(paired end reads, 5 lanes).
Clock: about 40 minutes.

The new output look like I expect it:
